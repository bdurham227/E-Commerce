## Description
The E-Commerce Database application is an ORM or Object Relational Mapping application that is built for a mock E-Commere website. The application's platform is a configured Express.JS API that uses Sequelize to interact with our MySQL database. The process for development was to first analyze and map out our database, build Models for our SQL Data, build our associations or relationships that our Models have with one another, seed our database and finally construct our API requests. This application was lot of fun to build out. It builds upon previous projects that culminates just to the point of being a fullstack application. Further developments I would like to see for this app is to build out the front end using MVC to complete our backend to frontend relationship!
